ðŸ”§ Step-by-Step for Windows Firewall

1. Open Windows Firewall Configuration Tool

Press Win + R, type wf.msc, and hit Enter to open Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security.


2. List Current Firewall Rules

In the left pane, select Inbound Rules.

Review the list to see all active rules.


3. Add a Rule to Block Inbound Traffic on a Specific Port (e.g., Port 23 for Telnet)

In the right pane, click New Ruleâ€¦

Choose Port > Click Next.

Select TCP, then enter 23 in "Specific local ports".

Click Next, select Block the connection.

Apply to Domain, Private, Public > Click Next.

Name it something like "Block Telnet (Port 23)" > Click Finish.


4. Test the Rule

Try connecting to the system using Telnet on port 23 from another machine (or locally using telnet localhost 23).

It should fail to connect due to the rule.


5. Add Rule to Allow SSH (Port 22)


Follow the same steps as in step 3.

Enter 22 as the port, and this time select Allow the connection.(as i performed this in my windows machine so i didn't do this)


6. Remove the Test Block Rule

Go back to Inbound Rules.

Find the rule "Block Telnet (Port 23)", right-click, and choose Delete.
